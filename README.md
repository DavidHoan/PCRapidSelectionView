# PCRapidSelectionView

Intended as a replacement for UIActionSheet, where only a few options need to be presented ( < 5/6). I wanted to create a control that allows for a continuous push and targeted selection. This should save the user time and brings joy. No 3D touch required, works iOS7 and upwards (iOS8 & 9 are tested). See the demo project or GIF for more info.
